# Personal-Loan-Data-Analysis-Project-using-Excel
Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis and visualization using Excel, identifying 4 distinct customer segments based on savings account activity and personal loan behavior.

Problem Statement (Situation):
“Finding out potential target customers for personal loans”
In this case study, the goal of HBFC bank is to sell more personal loans to their savings account
holders. The bank wants to start a campaign to sell the personal loans, but before that they
want to analyze last marketing campaign data to understand the profile of potential loan
customers. This will help them in doing a targeted approach to the prospective customers in
future. The bank has approached you, to help them with the analysis of the previous campaign
data. The bank basically has two customers,
* Liability customers – They deposit the money in the bank and pays interest against
the deposited money.
* Asset customers - They borrow money (take different types of loan) from the bank
and the bank charges interest against the borrowed money

At present the bank has small number of asset/loan customers. The bank wants to increase
their income by increasing the customer base of “asset customers”. Last year the bank ran a
campaign where they successfully converted 9% of the existing “liability customers” to “asset
customers”. This has encouraged the bank to have a better targeted marketing campaign to
increase the success ratio with minimum budget.

You would receive a file Bank.xls which contains data of 5000 customers. It includes,
* Customer demographic information (age, income, etc.),
* Relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.)
* Customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
* Among the 5000 customers, only 480 (9.6%) customers have accepted the personal
loan in the last year campaign.
